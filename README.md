# Matter of Time (2022)

Small 2D puzzle game made entirely in C, using the MinilibX framework to make things appear on screen.

The game is about getting an hourglass to the other side of several maps, trying not to run out of sand in the process. Have fun and remember:

Time never walks backwards, 
it only goes back to the very beginning... âŒ›

# Compatibility

Unfortunately, MinilibX is not compatible with Windows, so I could only provide a Mac and Linux version.
Just download and run the executable in the corresponding folder.
